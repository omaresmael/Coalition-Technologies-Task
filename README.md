## TODO LIST

I Have created a simple Todo list where each task is corresponding to Project
## SETUP 

- Run `composer install`
- Add `.env` file
- Run  `php artisan key:generate`
- Run `php artisan migrate`
- Run `php artisan serve`
## FEATURES
- display Projects 
- display the number of their tasks
- add new project
- show the tasks of project 
- change priority by drag and drop 
- create - edit - delete - tasks 

### What is missing?

- Error handling 
- Js refactor
- Better Algorithm for priority change (It will be solving by refactoring the js but time!)

I'm looking foreword to discuss the better algorithm with you in the interview :'D
